We used 2022 dataset in this project.

Abstract: There has always been a high demand for software development and tech-related jobs in market and the programming community plays a vital role to comprehend this employment sector. While speaking of a tech community, Stack Overflow is the most popular one since programmers and developers from diverse categories participate here very frequently. Over the past few years, Stack Overflow has been conducting yearly surveys on its users to collect information about how they learn and upgrade themselves, which tools they are utilizing, and what they enjoy in development.
In this project, we applied an exploratory data analysis on this survey-based dataset--called the Stack Overflow Developer Survey (SODS)--to understand current state of the job market. For this purpose, we investigated correlations between factors and variables related the software development industry. We presented data visualization to compare and analyze those variables. We applied different data mining methods on SODS dataset--including frequent pattern analysis and classification techniques. In addtion, we attempted to find answers to few relevant questions and to test a hypothesis that articulates gender diversity in tech organizations. We believe, our findings will help job seekers to understand contemporary situations in tech-based job field. In addition, employers can also exploit our outcomes to examine their hiring strategies. We presented the lessons we learned from our investigation and these observation will work as strong references for advanced research in future on survey-based datasets.
